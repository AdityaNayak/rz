<h5 class="bkc bold">Major Challenge(s)</h5>
The first indigenous Ship-lift, Challenging weather conditions, Rough Sea conditions of Bay of Bengal, Sub-projects
across multiple locations

<p class="pullout compass m-ws-top"><span class="bkc f-1-25x">The cost of delay in the project was over a crore a day, only in interest costs.</span> The opportunity cost of delay, especially of the Ship-lift, was extremely high. Without the Ship-lift, business could not commence.
</p>
The time taken by Syncrolift, the world’s leader in Ship-lifts, to commission a 25% smaller Shiplift in Karwar was 26 months. L&T was manufacturing every part of the Ship-lift indigenously across 3 locations and the target was to deliver the entire Shipyard in 27 months.

<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution Element(s)</h5>

Integrated plan for driving execution, Rigorous Full Kitting on Execution and Installation and Commissioning readiness, Concerto to leverage plan – Synchronize day-to-day execution and generate Forward-looking alerts for control

The methodology and software was implemented in the project. The key differences that prior systems did not provide were:

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Integrated plan</h6> Sub-projects across locations were integrated in one single plan for complete visibility

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">2-tier planning methodology</h6> Simple and stable project plans for driving execution

<h6 class="bkc bold nm"> Rigorous Full Kitting practice</h6>
Sub-project level readiness criteria defined and monitored through Concerto for commencement of execution and Installation and
Commissioning phases. Project Manager took charge of monitoring and releasing Full Kits with full preparation

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Forward-looking alerts</h6>
Portfolio/ project level forward-looking alerts for management meant pro-active actions. E.g. Concerto predicted huge delay in Ship-lift piling
work 18 months in advance, allowing management to recover the project through various pro-active recovery actions
<h5 class="bkc bold"> Results achieved by client</h5>
<p class="pullout check m-ws-top bkc f-1-25x">
The entire Shipyard, along with the Ship-lift was commissioned in 28 months and the first production order was taken in to execution in the 24th month

		Creating a world-class shipyard and a 200m shiplift totally in-house involved many challenges. Yet the project was completed in 28 months, overcoming most delays and uncertainties. This was possible primarily due to dedicated team effort. The team from Realization was involved in coordination, planning and monitoring the project throughout
