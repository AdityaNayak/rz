<h5 class="bkc bold">Major Challenge(s)</h5>
<p class="pullout compass m-ws-top"><span class="bkc f-1-25x">Project team created mostly from Operations for one-time expansion projects, Heavy monsoons, Remote location where high mobilization is difficult and the usual challenges of expansion projects.</span></p>

At an organizational level, the primary requirement of management was reliability of due-date projections, as marketing efforts were linked to the commencement of production. Every month of delay had huge impact on bottom-line numbers, thus making on-time completion the primary requirement


<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution Element(s)</h5>
Integrated Focus-&-Finish plans, Rigorous Full-Kitting processes for ensuring execution, monsoon and
installation and commissioning readiness, Concerto for leveraging the implemented methodology to generate forward-looking alerts

The methodology and software was implemented in the projects. The key differences that prior systems did not provide were:

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">2-tier planning methodology</h6>
Simple and stable project plans ranging between 150 – 200 Focus-&-Finish tasks

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Management processes established to drive pro-active actions on Concerto signals</h6>
Review structure implemented and driven to exploit thin management
capacity

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Full Kit management</h6>
Concerto provided full visibility of FK readiness and management processes were put in place for driving closure of FK prior to key phases
in execution (Commencing civil works, monsoon readiness, equipment installation)

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Contractor Alignment</h6>
It was made sure that the plan created win-win situation by maximizing contractor’s cash flow without compromising on due-date
deliverables

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Synchronized execution</h6>
Dynamic and Prioritized schedules for aligning various teams

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Forward-looking alerts</h6>
Portfolio/ project level forward-looking alerts for management meant pro-active actions. E.g. Concerto predicted huge delays due to
slow pace of ordering, prompting Top Management to clear calendar for ordering decisions/ negotiations and delay recovery

<h5 class="bkc bold">Results achieved by client</h5>

<p class="pullout check m-ws-top bkc f-1-25x">The first project was delivered on-time in 13 months - 33% faster than similar expansion executed previously in 18 months

The second project was delivered on-time in 18 months
