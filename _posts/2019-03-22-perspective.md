Infrastructure Projects are large, complex and dynamic. The project
managers must be always pro-active to the continuously emerging
challenges and risks.

With the advent of new technologies and tools the project teams have
been able to capture project data faster and in real-time. But this is not
an end to the problem. In fact this has added complexity for the
project managers by delaying their responses. How?

First, the data remains scattered and disjointed across multiple
(Planning, scheduling, procurement, engineering, progress updates)
systems.


So the project managers have a daunting task at hand of deriving a
meaningful information out of this data to find critical answers like–

<h5 class="bkc bold">What are the most critical issues directly impacting my project
timeline?</h5>

When and Where do I need my team to work?

Again, even after collecting the data from multiple systems and
aligning them manually, the final decisions are based on
individual interpretations and gut feeling. This makes project
manager’s life difficult to find the critical answers accurately
like-

When will my project get completed?

What is the cash flow status which may disrupt my project
progress?
