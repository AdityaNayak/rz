<h5 class="bkc bold">Major Challenge(s)</h5>
Project team created mostly from Operations for one-time expansion, High interaction with existing operations, Proximity to production line – high temperatures made working difficult

Vardhman is best known for its textiles business but more than 10 percent of the group's turnover is due to Vardhman Special Steels Limited (VSSL). In 2009, VSSL’s Managing Director, Mr. Sachit Jain, established very aggressive growth goals for VSSL and embarked on a ₹ 200 Cr expansion planned to be completed in 14 months

<p class="pullout compass m-ws-top"><span class="bkc f-1-25x">Cost of delay was more than ₹ 1.1 Crore in lost sales per day.</span>
Most importantly, in this project were 2 shutdowns that, if delayed, would disrupt existing orders and
lead to very unhappy customers</p>

<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution Element(s)</h5>
Integrated Focus-&-Finish plans, Rigorous Full-Kitting processes for ensuring execution and installation and
commissioning readiness, Special review process with main vendor and sub-vendors, Concerto for leveraging the implemented
methodology to generate forward-looking alerts

The methodology and software was implemented in the projects. The key differences that prior systems did not provide were:

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">2-tier planning methodology</h6>
Simple and stable project plans with ~150 Focus-&-Finish tasks

Management processes established to drive pro-active actions on Concerto signals: Review structure implemented and driven to exploit thin management
capacity

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Full Kit management</h6>
Concerto provided full visibility of FK readiness and management processes were put in place for driving closure of FK prior to key phases
in execution (Commencing civil works, equipment installation)

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Contractor Alignment</h6>
Main vendor and its own downstream were aligned to ensure on-time manufacturing across 6 locations and supply to site

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Synchronized execution</h6>
Dynamic and Prioritized schedules for aligning various teams

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Forward-looking alerts</h6>
Portfolio/ project level forward-looking alerts for management meant pro-active actions. E.g. Concerto predicted huge delays due to
slow pace of ordering, prompting Top Management to clear calendar for ordering decisions/ negotiations and delay recovery

<h5 class="bkc bold nm">Results achieved by client</h5>

<p class="pullout check m-ws-top"><div class="bkc f-1-25x">The project was delivered on-time in 13 months, 1.5 months ahead of management expectations</div>
Both shutdowns were completed faster than planned

	<p class="s wc">
		We finished the project 1.5 months earlier than management expectations. In the first shutdown, we not only finished 1-day early, but we were also able to pull in additional scope. In intangibles, there was minimal fire-fighting. The communication that happened across the organization was fantastic.
