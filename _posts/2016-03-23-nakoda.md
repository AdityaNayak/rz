<h5 class="bkc bold">Major Challenge(s)</h5>
<p class="pullout compass m-ws-top"><span class="bkc f-1-25x">Project team created mostly from Operations for one-time expansion projects, Heavy monsoons, Inadequate
mobilization by contractor, Usual challenges of expansion projects, incurred ~ 45 days of delay after the first 3 months of execution
</span></p>
At an organizational level, the primary requirement of management was reliability of due-date projections, as marketing efforts were linked to the commencement of production. Every month of delay had huge impact on bottom-line numbers, thus making on-time completion the primary requirement


<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution Element(s)</h5>
Integrated Focus-&-Finish plans, Full-Kitting processes for ensuring faster execution, monsoon and installation
and commissioning readiness, Concerto for generating forward-looking alerts

The methodology and software was implemented in the projects. The key differences that prior systems did not provide were:

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">2-tier planning methodology</h6>
Simple and stable project plans ranging between 50 – 70 Focus-&-Finish tasks that require zero maintenance efforts

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Full Kit management</h6>
Concerto provided full visibility of readiness before starting major streams of work in execution

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Contractor Alignment</h6> 
It was made sure that the plan created win-win situation by maximizing contractor’s cash flow without compromising on due-date
deliverables

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Synchronized execution</h6>
Dynamic and Prioritized schedules for aligning various teams

<h6 class="bkc bold nm">Enhanced management visibility through ‘Forward-looking alerts’</h6>
Portfolio/ project level forward-looking alerts for management meant pro-active actions.
E.g. Concerto predicted huge delays due to slow pace of ordering, prompting Top Management to clear calendar for ordering decisions/ negotiations and delay
recovery


<h5 class="bkc bold">Results achieved by client</h5>
<p class="pullout check m-ws-top bkc f-1-25x">
The project management team took advantage of early warning signals to accelerate execution. The project was delivered in 12 months – 3 months faster than industry benchmark
