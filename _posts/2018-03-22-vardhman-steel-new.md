<h5 class="bkc bold nm">Challenge</h5>
<h5 class="bold">Increase capacity without any major disruption and risking revenue</h5>

Vardhman Special Steels, an Indian steel manufacturer that produces sheets, rods, and bars, had reached full capacity,
running overtime to meet customer demand. To increase capacity, Vardhman committed to a bold expansion project
that would cost ₹ 200 Cr, and take 14.5 months. More crucially, it would also require two 15-day shutdowns of existing
production lines, first one in the middle of the project and the second towards the end: any delay in the shutdowns
would cause loss of planned production and unhappy customers, and <strong>cost the firm 1.1 Cr per day</strong>. A “victim” of its
own success, Vardhman could not build any anticipatory inventory without shorting its current accounts; its output was
already fully committed.

The project was complex not only because engineering, procurement, construction, installation, and testing tasks had to
be coordinated within and across functions, but also due to the coordination required between the project and ongoing
operations. Tasks had to be performed in a certain order, so any delay in one part of the project could quickly cascade to
the rest of the project. However, like all projects, routine delays and changes were expected on this project too. For
example, delays in engineering, placements of orders, communication with suppliers, delivery from suppliers, labor
availability, etc. are all too common and unavoidable.
Another complication was the coordination required on the supplier’s end. The Italian supplier of new manufacturing
equipment had multiple locations participating in its supply — three in Europe, four in India — that complicated
procurement and required close coordination among their and Vardhman’s engineers.
Vardhman’s senior management, fearing losses incurred by delays, stressed speed above all other priorities. Although
the firm had a skilled operations team, it had no experienced project managers who could carry out the coordination
and use their judgment to identify and control critical delays. — yet this was Vardhman’s largest capital expansion
project to date.

Management has this realization that their project management infrastructure is not adequate to take up all these
challenges because: 
1. An integrated execution plan was missing 
2. The data was spread across multiple
systems, leading to a disconnected view between project stakeholders. 
3. Management lacked Ready-to-Act information where they can make faster decisions.

Therefore, the senior management wanted a scheduling and decision support system that could provide relevant
schedules and management information during execution.

<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution</h5>

Vardhman decided to implement Realization’s project Delivery system Concerto for Ready-to-Act information
in projects. It provided ready-to-act alerts for executives and ready-to-act schedules for the
frontline.
Though Vardhman has evaluated other systems as well but Concerto, compared to other systems, was the
only system that went beyond mere planning to:

<h5 class="bold">1. Converts plans into detailed execution schedules that allowed teams to work in a “focus and finish” mode instead of spreading resources thin.</h5>

For example, instead of all work packages in civil works being in progress but none of them completed while
structural and equipment erection teams wait for work-fronts to be available, Concerto ensured that critical
civil work packages were completed and handed over in entirety.
The advantage was that every team always had complete work-fronts available before they engaged and could
concentrate their resources, finish their work uninterrupted and hand over complete work-fronts, in turn, to
the next team.

Similarly during installation, instead of having the project team create workarounds during installation and
commissioning due to work-fronts not being fully available, it ensured that all utilities were up and running
before commissioning of production equipment started; as a result, the plant was ready for production the
the moment production line was commissioned.

“The contractor always started work with full work-front and drawings available to them. He was very
confident that his people will not get stuck in the middle for either drawings or materials”

<h5 class="bold">2. Instead of responding to delays by re-planning the entire project, it kept the original plan
but identified schedule risks and future tasks that could be expedited.</h5>
For example, Concerto highlighted risks to project completion nearly 7 months in advance. The advance warning allowed the management team to start a process of joint reviews with the equipment manufacturer and manage coordination across all their locations to ensure timely release of orders for bought out items at
the supplier’s end. This, in turn, ensured a smooth flow of complete inputs to the design consultant, expedited
release of approved GFC drawings to site teams and on-time completion of the project.

<div class="callout dbbg">
	<p class="s wc">We realized that coordination among the supplier’s various sites was a bigger problem than the coordination
between us and our contractors, and so we got that organization to talk better to themselves”
— Sachit Jain, MD, VSSL
</p>
</div>

<h5 class="bold">3. Integrated daily and weekly progress reports with the project plan</h5>
One pervasive reason as to why project management systems do not get successfully used is that it is very
difficult to ensure timely updates across the organization. Concerto directly feeds tracking data into the plans
and automatically converts daily progress data into project progress information.


<h5 class="bkc bold">Solution</h5>

By following the daily schedules generated by Concerto, and acting on its management information, Vardhman
was able to minimize work stoppages and ensure that work got done in accordance with its criticality for the
overall project.

<h5 class="bkc bold nm">Results achieved by client</h5>

<p class="pullout check m-ws-top"><div class="bkc f-1-25x">The project was delivered on-time in 13 months, 1.5 months ahead of management expectations</div>
Successful completion 1.5 months early
In a project with little room for error, Concerto not only helped Vardhman meet its construction goals, it beat them.
Both anticipated line shutdowns were shortened, saving the firm hundreds of thousands of dollars. The project
was delivered in 13 months, 1.5 months ahead of management expectations, saving even more money and enabling
Vardhman to translate expanded capacity into additional revenues faster.

		We finished the project 1.5 months earlier than management expectations. In the first shutdown, we not only finished 1-day early, but we were also able to pull in additional scope. In intangibles, there was minimal fire-fighting. The communication that happened across the organization was fantastic.
